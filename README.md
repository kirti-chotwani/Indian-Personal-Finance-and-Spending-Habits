## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
An initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and identify key features related to individuals' financial situations.
## 2. Univariate Analysis
Salary distribution: Visualizes income trends across individuals.
Age distribution: Understands the age demographics in the dataset.
City tier distribution: Analyzes the representation of individuals from different city tiers.
## 3. Expense Analysis
